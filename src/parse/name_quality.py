"""Narrator name-quality cleaning + validation (da#247).

Removes the non-name pollution classes that leak into the canonical narrator
table — markup tags, honorific/eulogy phrases, mubham (anonymous) collective
descriptors, and over-long phrase/text spans — recovering the real name where
possible and rejecting the span otherwise. Applied at the NER stage over *every*
source (``src/resolve/ner.py``) so the pollution never reaches disambiguation.

Background (da#247): on the pre-fix resolve output 39.9% of canonical narrators
(115,405 / 289,385) had polluted names — three root causes:

1. ``<NAR>`` / ``<IDF>`` markup leakage (sanadset) — literal, often unclosed /
   nested tags left in the name (``"<NAR> ابو عبيده"``). The existing
   ``_is_narrator_like`` filter missed them because ``is_arabic`` accepts *mixed*
   Latin+Arabic. Stripped here (recovers ``"ابو عبيده"``), not dropped.
2. thaqalayn parser dumping whole hadith bodies into the name field — hundreds of
   tokens of Arabic + English text. Caught by the token-count cap.
2b. English-only sources putting translated isnad PROSE in the name field — a
   "name" that is really a sentence fragment (``"It was narrated…"``, ``"The
   Prophet said…"``, ``"his father"``). Caught by an English non-name leader-word
   guard; romanized real names (``"Abu Huraira"``, ``"Al-Zuhri"``) are kept.
2c. English ``<name>:<matn>`` colon-joins (da#253) — a companion name colon-joined
   to a hadith body (``"Thawban:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sacrificed during a
   journey and then…"``). This defeats BOTH 2b guards: the leader guard only
   inspects ``tokens[0]`` (here ``"Thawban:The"`` — the colon is *internal*, so
   ``"thawban:the"`` is not a leader), and the ~11-token body sits under the token
   cap. Handled two ways: (i) truncate the span at the first colon whose tail
   begins with an English leader — recovering the pre-colon name (``"Thawban"``);
   (ii) a residual embedded-prose guard drops any span carrying two or more
   whole-token English function/stop words (real romanized names carry zero;
   Arabic script never matches an ASCII word).
3. mubham (unnamed) descriptors minted as named narrators — both *collective*
   phrases (``"رجل من اصحاب النبي"``, ``"جماعه من اصحاب"``) and bare *relational
   pronouns* (``"ابيه"`` "his father", ``"جده"`` "his grandfather"), plus bare
   honorific phrases. The relational-pronoun sub-class was the residual after the
   first da#247 pass: ``ابيه`` alone remained the single most-mentioned "narrator"
   (65,755) on the #723 stage reload because it has no partitive ``من`` for the
   collective guard to catch.

The Arabic-script residual (da#258) — the direct sibling of da#253's English
``<name>:<matn>`` fix — is three more classes that leak *Arabic* isnad/matn text
into the name field, none catchable by a token-count cap (real ``ibn``-lineage
names reach ~30 tokens):

4. **Genuine matn body** — a whole sentence dumped in the name field
   (``"كان علي بن ابي طالب بالكوفه في الجامع اذ قام اليه رجل …"`` "Ali ibn Abi
   Talib was in Kufa in the mosque when a man stood …"). Signalled by Arabic
   matn/verb function words (``كان``/``قال``/``اذ``/``الذي``/``لما``/…), NOT by
   length. Dropped — but only when no real leading name precedes the matn.
5. **Chain-connective fragments** — a real name followed by an isnad connective
   that opens the *next* link: ``"ابو عبد الرحمن عن ابي هريره"`` ("Abu Abd
   al-Rahman FROM Abu Huraira"), ``"سالم بن عبد الله ان عبد الله بن عمر"``,
   ``"ابو العنبس الذي …"``, ``"بندار هو محمد بن بشار"`` (an editorial gloss).
   Truncated at the connective, keeping the leading name (recovers ``"بندار"`` =
   Ibn Bashshar, ``"عاءشه"`` from ``"عاءشه قالت كان"``) — the Arabic mirror of
   da#253's :func:`_truncate_colon_prose`.
6. **Compound co-narrator joins** — multiple REAL narrators joined by ``و … جميعا``
   / ``X و Y و Z قالوا`` ("… together" / "… they said"): ``"سعد بن عبد الله و عبد
   الله بن جعفر الحميري جميعا"``. These must be **split into separate narrators,
   not dropped** — losing the co-narrators (and their mention edges) is a
   regression. :func:`split_compound_narrators` is the detection+split primitive;
   emitting one mention row per split member is a resolve-stage (``ner.py``) change
   tracked as a scoped follow-up, so :func:`clean_narrator_name` deliberately does
   **not** drop an un-split compound (no matn token fires on a name-only ``و``-join).

Classes 4+5 unify into a single **truncate-at-first-isnad-boundary** rule
(:data:`_ISNAD_BOUNDARY`): cut the span at the first matn-verb / connective /
relative-pronoun / gloss token and keep the preceding real name; if that boundary
token *leads* the span (no name before it) the span is dropped (the real narrator
sits after an elided-grammar verb and is unrecoverable here). A residual
matn-density backstop (:data:`_MATN_DENSITY`, ≥2) drops any sentence whose first
boundary is a non-verb preposition the truncation cannot anchor on.

Benediction / Prophet-reference residual (da#271) — two more classes surfaced by
the candidate-pair-inflation audit, both concentrated in thaqalayn/lk:

7. **Bare Shia taṣliya** — ``صلى الله عليه واله`` (without the trailing ``وسلم`` the
   existing honorific set required), which left "رسول الله صلى الله عليه واله" (an
   mc-365 false narrator) intact. Added to :data:`_HONORIFIC_PHRASES`.
8. **Prophet references** — after the taṣliya is stripped the residue is a bare
   title (``رسول الله``, ``النبي``, ``نبي الله``): the Prophet is the matn source,
   not an isnad narrator. Dropped by :func:`_is_prophet_reference` (leader-anchored).

Sentence / matn-body drop-gate (da#308) — the residual after da#258. The
boundary-truncation (classes 4+5) only fires on the specific verb / connective /
gloss tokens in :data:`_ISNAD_BOUNDARY`; a matn sentence whose opener is NOT one
of those (``قلت`` "I said", ``كنا`` "we were", ``نهى`` "forbade", ``صلى`` "prayed",
``امر`` "ordered"), a grading-commentary formula (``حديث حسن صحيح``, ``هذا حديث``),
or a quoted-speech / question span (``«…»`` / ``؟``) slips through and survives as
a canonical narrator — on run-4b ~15% (25,971) of canonical names were such matn.

9. **Matn / commentary sentence** — a whole hadith body or grading gloss kept as a
   name (``"قلت لابي عبد الله ذهبت ارمي فاذا في يدي ست حصيات"``,
   ``"ابو عيسى هذا حديث حسن صحيح"``). Dropped by :func:`_is_matn_sentence`, which
   combines matn signals (verb-led opener, grading formula, matn punctuation, and a
   verb/particle density backstop) — a bare token-count ceiling is deliberately
   NOT a signal on its own. The **precision guard** is nasab-connector density
   (:data:`_NASAB_CONNECTORS`, measured DIACRITICS-INSENSITIVELY so a vocalized
   ``بْنُ`` counts): a genuine ``ibn``-lineage / kunya-nasab string is spared from
   the length / punctuation / density signals regardless of how long it is, so real
   nasab chains, nisba tails, and kunya compounds pass through unchanged. A
   nisba-transition ``ثم`` between two ``ال``-nisbas (``"…الليثي ثم الجندعي"``) is
   likewise no longer truncated as a matn boundary.

The phrase constants are in **normalized-Arabic** form (post
``normalize_arabic``) because this runs on ``name_normalized``.
